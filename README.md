## Unwanted Spam Calls in the United States
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has created a dashboard that tracks unwanted calls. This dataset is updated every day with new unwanted calls reflected. The purpose of this project is to look at trends regarding unwanted spam calls. In this project, I wanted to see annual trends, where these calls are more likely to take place, when these calls are most likely to occur, which months get the most number of unwanted calls, and the methods by which consumers receive these unwanted calls. While data collection started in 2000, this data looks at data from 2014 up until November 22, 2020. This is because the FCC started regularly updating this dataset. 

This data was freely available to download from the Federal Communications Commission. The dataset used in this project can be obtained [here](https://opendata.fcc.gov/Consumer/Consumer-Complaints-Data-Unwanted-Calls/vakf-fz8e).
