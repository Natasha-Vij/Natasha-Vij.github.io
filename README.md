## COVID-19 Dashboard

The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease that has affected virtually every nation in the world. News first broke about this virus that started in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019. 
This disease continuous to run rampant throughout the world almost half-way through 2021, with new variants emerging regularly. 

The purpose of this project is to visualize which countries are leading in both disease transmission and vaccine administration. This project was created to observe trends that identifies how nations across the world are handling the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the factors that this project will address include the number of new cases, testing, hospitalization admissions, deaths, and vaccine administration. This project will categorize visualizations based on date, nation, and continent.

## Analysis of Military, Education, and Healthcare Spending
In this project, I analyzed the overall military, education, and healthcare spending in light of their GDP. Specifically, I looked at the military, education, and healthcare spending trends of the G20 countries in the years of 2012-2016. I aimed to compare sector spending to overall GDP spending, per capita spending to overall per capita GDP spending, comparing each sector in today GDP spending, and single out fastest growing countries in all three sectors. 

I obtained my datasets from SIPRI, the World Health Organization, and the World Bank.

## Analysis of Contemporary Mass Shooters in the United States
The Stanford Geospatial Center has compiled a dataset that details incidents of mass shootings. My team and I noticed that the dataset contained dimensions related to the shooter, so we decided to craft a SMART research question that would meet all of the criteria of a SMART question. We decided to answer the following question: "Is the contemporary mass shooter in America similar to the average American demographically?"

After completing an exploratory data analysis on our dataset, we determined that we would be able to test similarities based on age, race, and sex. Using both z-tests and chi-squared tests, my team and I found that the average mass shooter in America is not in fact similar to the average American. Based on our testing, we found what demographic characteristics policy makers should be focused on  in order to help stop instances of mass shootings.

## Unwanted Spam Calls in the United States
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has created a dashboard that tracks unwanted calls. This dataset is updated every day with new unwanted calls reflected. The purpose of this project is to look at trends regarding unwanted spam calls. In this project, I wanted to see annual trends, where these calls are more likely to take place, when these calls are most likely to occur, which months get the most number of unwanted calls, and the methods by which consumers receive these unwanted calls. While data collection started in 2000, this data looks at data from 2014 up until November 22, 2020. This is because the FCC started regularly updating this dataset. 

This data was freely available to download from the Federal Communications Commission. The dataset used in this project can be obtained [here](https://opendata.fcc.gov/Consumer/Consumer-Complaints-Data-Unwanted-Calls/vakf-fz8e).

## Hate Crimes in the United States (1991-2018)
In this project, I analyzed hate crimes in the Unted States from 1991-2018. In particular, I looked at what groups are most likely to be targeted, what groups are more likely to commit crimes, where these crimes are happening in the country, and how major political events affect hate crime occurances.
