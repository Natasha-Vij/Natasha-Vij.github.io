                <h2>Conclusions:</h2>
                <h3>
                    Total Sector Spending in USD and Per Capita Spending:
                    <p></p>
                    Overall, it is clear to see that the United States leads in all sectors examined in terms of per capita and total spending. There were 
                    three interesting finds from this analysis:
                    <p></p>
                    <li>Russia is ranked considerably high in total military spending.</li>
                    <li>Saudi Arabia is ranked considerably high in total military per capita spending</li>
                    <li>Australia is ranked considerably high in per capita education spending</li>
                </h3>
                <p></p>
                <h3>
                    Comparing Total GDP Spending By Sector:
                    <p></p>
                    This section was interesting to look at because it gives a strong overview about what each country values. As mentioned earlier, Russia spends far more money on its GDP on military spending, 
                    while it doesn't spend as much on education and healthcare spending. Japan and Germany tend to focus their GDP spending more on education and healthcare and less on military spending. 
                </h3>
                <p></p>
                <h3>
                    Fastest Growing Countries:
                    <p></p>
                    Overall, it is intersting to see the absolute and percent change in how nations spent their GDP between 2012 and 2016. China clearly grew in their spending amounts in all sectors during the interval.
                    Countries like Russia and Japan significantly dropped the amount they were spending on military, healthcare, and education over the same time period. 
                    <p></p>
